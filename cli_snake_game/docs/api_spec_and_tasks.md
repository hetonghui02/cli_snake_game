## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
pygame==2.0.1
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required.
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No API spec required as this is a standalone application.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program. It should initialize the game and start the game loop."),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which handles the game loop, user input, and game over conditions."),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which handles the movement, growth, and collision detection of the snake."),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which handles the generation and positioning of food items.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'pygame' library is used for creating the game. It provides functionalities such as handling user input, updating the game state, and rendering the game on the screen.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the program. It initializes the game and starts the game loop.

The 'game.py' file contains the Game class which handles the game loop, user input, and game over conditions.

The 'snake.py' file contains the Snake class which handles the movement, growth, and collision detection of the snake.

The 'food.py' file contains the Food class which handles the generation and positioning of food items.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points at the moment. The requirements and the implementation approach are clear. The team can start with the implementation of the 'main.py' file, followed by 'game.py', 'snake.py', and 'food.py'. The 'pygame' library should be initialized in the 'main.py' file before starting the game loop.
